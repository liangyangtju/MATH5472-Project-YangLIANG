# GBDT Counterfactual Analysis

**What If Without Gradient Boosted Trees: An Evolutionary Analysis of Tabular Data Prediction**

## 📋 Project Overview

This project, based on the requirements of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology MATH 5472 course, conducts a counterfactual analysis of Gradient Boosted Trees (GBDT), exploring "How would tabular data prediction technology have evolved without GBDT?"

### Paper Structure
1. **Need**: The Challenges of Tabular Data Prediction
2. **Approach**: The Three-Layer Architectural Design of GBDT
3. **Benefits**: Validation of GBDT's Advantages
4. **Competitors**: Counterfactual Evolutionary Analysis

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Using a virtual environment is recommended

### Installation Steps

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/liangyangtju/MATH5472-Project-YangLIANG.git
